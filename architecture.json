  "cover_prompt": "A lone figure, a data-thief clad in layered, rain-slicked fabrics, kneels in a flooded alleyway, their hand submerged not in water but in a glowing, liquid stream of cascading data-rain, from which a single, luminous and impossibly real tree root begins to physically emerge and coil around their fingers. The scene is a neo-noir cityscape of towering data-spires and decaying concrete, where digital rain falls in shimmering curtains, and vibrant, organic moss and circuitry compete across wet surfaces, creating a tapestry of curated civilization and wild, remembered nature. In the atmospheric style of a synthesis between Moebius's intricate linework and the dense, symbolic urban melancholy of Edward Hopper, rendered as a hyper-detailed matte painting with analog texture. Book cover framing, a centered and intimate composition viewed from a low, dramatic angle that emphasizes the thief's act of reverence and the root's ascent. Cinematic chiaroscuro lighting where the only illumination comes from the bioluminescent data-rain and the root's own soft glow, casting long, dramatic shadows, within a color palette of deep indigo, electric cyan, and data-stream gold contrasted against muted concrete grays and the rich, earthy umber of the living root. masterpiece, best quality, ultra detailed, intricate details, professional composition, sharp focus, 8k resolution, flux dev."
