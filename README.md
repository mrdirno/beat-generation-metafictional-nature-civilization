## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where a character 'reads' a non-digital text in the Sprawl (e.g., the pattern of cracks in a wall, the flight of a rare bird, the taste of unprocessed water).
- Create a folio of 'civic poetry' from the Municipal servers—bureaucratic, compliance-focused verse that Cassian might disdain but find useful.
- Draft a chapter from the perspective of a Curator, tasked with analyzing and neutralizing the 'organic signal' as a threat to civic harmony.
- Write a monologue for Elara, the bartender of The Bardo, explaining why she keeps 'none of the stories' for herself.

### Technical Entry Points

- Design a 'dermal layer' interface system: a speculative UI/UX for how citizens might tune their skin to filter or absorb the data-rain.
- Build a generative text model that produces 'Pre-Fall Organic Fragments'—short, ambiguous, nature-adjacent texts that feel discovered, not written.
